## Introduction
Bike sharing system is an innovative transportation strategy that provides individuals with bikes for their common use on a short-term basis for a price or for free. Over the last few decades, there has been a significant increase in the popularity of bike-sharing systems all over the world. This is because it is an environmentally sustainable, convenient and economical way of improving urban mobility. In addition to this, this system also helps to promote healthier habits among its users and reduce fuel consumption.

### The goals of this project are:
Understand the trends in the data and identify key factors affecting the demand for rental bikes.
Build an appropriate regression model to forecast the number of rental bikes required.

### Problem Statement:
In the future, maintaining a steady supply of rental bikes for the city may prove to be a difficult undertaking due to the expanding demand and user base for bike-sharing systems. The quality of the facilities must fulfil the demands and expectations of the users in order for the bike-sharing programme to be successful. As a result, it's critical to make sure that rental bikes are accessible and available at the appropriate times for riders, as doing so decreases waiting times. The management of the bike-sharing system can be substantially aided by forecasting the necessary number of bikes and identifying the major elements that affect the demand for rental bikes.
